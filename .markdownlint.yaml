# .markdownlint.yaml
# This configuration file is used to enforce style guidelines for Markdown files.
# The rules specified here will help ensure consistency and readability of the content.

# Rule: MD024
# Enforces consistent heading levels. This setting ensures that headings are sequential and sibling headings are not skipped.
# "siblings_only: true" enforces that headings should only skip levels within the same block of content (e.g., H2 -> H3),
# but not across different blocks (e.g., H1 -> H3).
MD024:
  siblings_only: true

# Rule: MD013
# Controls the maximum line length in Markdown files. Lines longer than this length will trigger a warning.
# The value "120" sets the maximum allowed line length to 120 characters.
MD013:
  line_length: 120

# Rule: MD025
# Allows multiple H1 headings in the same Markdown file.
MD025: false
