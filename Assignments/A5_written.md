## Logistics

### 📄 Assignment Format

This is a **written assignment**, not a coding assignment.

- Complete the assignment **by hand or typed up**
- You may write:
  - in a markdown file
  - on paper
  - on a tablet
  - using a stylus or digital note-taking app
- After completing the assignment, **scan or export your work** and upload it to Canvas

You may use **any format you prefer**, but your submission \*_must be neat and legible_

### 📤 Submission Instructions

- Upload **one file** to Canvas
- Accepted formats: **PDF, PNG, or JPG**
- Make sure all pages are clearly visible and in the correct order

### ✅ Checklist Before Submitting

- [ ] Assignment completed by hand
- [ ] Writing is neat and legible
- [ ] Title block provided on each page
- [ ] All questions answered
- [ ] File uploaded successfully to Canvas

### 🤝 Collaboration / AI tools

You may discuss concepts with classmates and you may use AI tools to help you learn, but **your submitted work must be
written by you and you must understand it**. If you used outside help, add a short note in the final reflection cell.

## Question 1 — Planar Truss (Hand Analysis + Code Verification)

Find (or design) a **simple, statically determinate planar truss** that can be solved using standard undergraduate
analysis techniques (e.g., **Method of Joints** and/or **Method of Sections**).

The truss may have any reasonable and stable geometry, but it should contain approximately **6–10 members**.

In your written submission:

- Clearly define:
  - Node numbering
  - Element numbering
  - Node coordinates
  - Support conditions
  - Applied loads
- Show all analytical steps.
- Compute and report:
  - All **support reactions**
  - The **axial force in every member**
  - Indicate whether each member is in **tension (+)** or **compression (−)**

In the coding assignment, you will solve this same structure using the computational framework developed in class.

The analytical results from your written solution will serve as a **verification benchmark** for your implementation.
